To be fair, this isn't a very original title. I promise to revamp this more in the future.

My name is Carrie and I'm finally finishing learning to code. I work at a SaaS company by day, but in the past I have worked as a professional sound engineer and I'm a total metal head.

I look forward to sharing my adventures in the world of coding. Stay safe out there, everyone!

Peace, love, beauty, freedom, heavy metal, but above all...love!
